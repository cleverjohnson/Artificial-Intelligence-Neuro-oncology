## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (A.I) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Currently A.I. includes systems that automatically customize hardware to user requirements and computerized medical diagnosticians. In the field of neuro-oncology, AI is known to offer support to the challenges in the field of neurology. The best example is of brain tumour assessment and diagnosis. Researchers Heidelberg University Hospital and the German Cancer Research centre after their research in areas within the FSP-E programme that focuses on cancer research with the aim of providing diagnosis and treatment of cancer, they came up with Computational Biomedicine which focuses on machine learning and information processing with the aim of improving cancer patient care through systematic data analytics. Building on advances in surgical, radiological, and clinical data sciences, such as image interpretation, holistic data processing and semantic modelling, IT platform technology is being developed to integrate the heterogeneous patient data including molecular characteristics and process data. So basically, in this article we discuss Artificial Inteligence base algorithms help neurologists and their patients.
