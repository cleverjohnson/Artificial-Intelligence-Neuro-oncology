### Abstract

There is no doubt that in the coming decades, deployment of Artificial Intellgence (AI) will play a very big role in the healthcare and neurosciences. In the aspect of neurosurgery, Artificial Intelligence is so vital since neurosurgery is one of the most technically demanding medical proffesions that vindicate a high level of expertise and AI can provide a great compliment to the neurosurgeon skills so as to provide the best interventional and non-interventional care for patients by enhancing diagonistic and prognostic outcomes in clinical treatment and aid the neurosurgeons with decision making during the surgical interventions to improve patients outcomes. Additionally, AI plays a pivotal role in producing, procesing and storing of clinical and experimental information. The use of Artificial Intelligence in neurosurgery can cause a reduction in the costs associated with surgical care and prodive relatively high quality healthcare to a several patients. This blog post will review the practical utility of AI in neurosciences from a clinical perspective. AI requires a thorough and systematic evaluation, prior to evaluation in the health sector.


### Introduction

The complexity of data used in clinical neurology is only likely to increase in the coming years as health records are digitalised and ‘data heavy’ technologies such as whole-genome sequencing become incorporated into routine clinical practice. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms offer a potential means to use these data more efficiently and effectively. However, a basic understanding of how these machine learning algorithms work is essential to help interpret and critically appraise their outputs, and so know what to believe.To quote Hippocrates, “Life is short, the art long, opportunity fleeting, experience treacherous and judgment difficult.” Clinical judgment has been the proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over a neurologist's head since time immemorial. In a recent study, the diagnostic accuracy of a doctor was considered to be far superior when pitted against artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, with a caveat that doctors also made incorrect diagnosis in 15% of cases.
Machine learning which is a part of AI, is a branch of data science which enables computers to learn from existind training data without explicit programming to make specualtions on new data points. A subclass of machine learning that is the deep learning bases on neural networks, containing a large number of layers, made possible due to recent computational advancements. In the radiomics research which focuses on medical imaging data as quantitative imaging biomarkers.The major aim of AI based research in neuro-oncologic imaging is to better understand the advanced manifestations of heterogeneous central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms in hopes of improving patient outcomes.

### Machine Learning Methods

Most applications of machine learning in medical imaging have relied on supervised forms of machine learning, which consist of algorithms that are trained on “ground truth” labels. Labels can include different classes of diagnoses (eg, high- vs lower-grade glioma), different prognoses (eg, long vs short survival), or different classes that exist within a single set of image volumes (eg, enhancing tumor vs necrotic tissue vs edema vs normal brain tissue). When provided with sufficient examples of the different classes, algorithms “learn” how to classify novel data. Supervised machine learning methods include logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, as well as tools useful for clinical decision support (eg, decision trees and Bayesian networks) (1,2). In general, these traditional supervised approaches are applied to explicitly engineered intermediate features, often after a step of feature reduction, which is necessary to reduce model complexity and avoid overfitting (ie, memorizing the training sample cases rather than learning the relevant pattern)—a prevalent problem that creeps into many machine learning studies without proper “held out” validation samples. These approaches, while powerful, oftentimes require extensive, domain-specific, expert knowledge about the underlying biologic basis of the process being studied. Another frequently used category of machine learning is unsupervised algorithms, such as k-means clustering, which can generate novel groupings or categories from complex data sets and have important roles in discovery science and big data.

### Current Methods in Neuro-Oncologic Imaging

Most research in neuro-oncology has focused on diffuse gliomas, World Health Organization (WHO) grade II–IV tumors, which are typically divided into lower-grade gliomas (WHO grade II and III) and glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) (18). Much work has focused on glioblastoma, given that it represents more than half of malignant primary brain tumors and has an aggressive course and grim prognosis (19). Lower-grade gliomas can sometimes progress into glioblastoma, and these are known as secondary glioblastomas. A variety of other brain tumors, including WHO grade I tumors, pediatric CNS tumors, primary CNS lymphoma, and brain metastases, encompass important areas of neuro-oncology but represent less-active areas of research given smaller sample sizes, more disease heterogeneity, and relatively lower morbidity.

### Conclusion

The overarching goal of this line of research is to improve the outcomes of patients affected by CNS neoplasms through improvements in diagnostic and treatment methods. AI tools that combine clinical, radiomic, and genomic information into predictive models hold substantial promise for guiding and monitoring personalized therapeutics. However, many challenges exist and much work needs to be done to bring the promise of this field into fruition. Nevertheless, radiologic practice will substantially change as AI technology continues to improve to be able to enhance radiologists’ accuracy and efficiency. It is crucial for the future radiologist to understand and appropriately use these powerful tools as they become more integrated into everyday clinical practice in the coming years.
