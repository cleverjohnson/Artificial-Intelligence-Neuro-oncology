### Abstract

There is no doubt that in the coming decades, deployment of Artificial Intellgence (AI) will play a very big role in the healthcare and neurosciences. In the aspect of neurosurgery, Artificial Intelligence is so vital since neurosurgery is one of the most technically demanding medical proffesions that vindicate a high level of expertise and AI can provide a great compliment to the neurosurgeon skills so as to provide the best interventional and non-interventional care for patients by enhancing diagonistic and prognostic outcomes in clinical treatment and aid the neurosurgeons with decision making during the surgical interventions to improve patients outcomes. Additionally, AI plays a pivotal role in producing, procesing and storing of clinical and experimental information. The use of Artificial Intelligence in neurosurgery can cause a reduction in the costs associated with surgical care and prodive relatively high quality healthcare to a several patients. This blog post will review the practical utility of AI in neurosciences from a clinical perspective. AI requires a thorough and systematic evaluation, prior to evaluation in the health sector.


### Introduction

The complexity of data used in clinical neurology is only likely to increase in the coming years as health records are digitalised and ‘data heavy’ technologies such as whole-genome sequencing become incorporated into routine clinical practice. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms offer a potential means to use these data more efficiently and effectively. However, a basic understanding of how these machine learning algorithms work is essential to help interpret and critically appraise their outputs, and so know what to believe.To quote Hippocrates, “Life is short, the art long, opportunity fleeting, experience treacherous and judgment difficult.” Clinical judgment has been the proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over a neurologist's head since time immemorial. In a recent study, the diagnostic accuracy of a doctor was considered to be far superior when pitted against artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, with a caveat that doctors also made incorrect diagnosis in 15% of cases.
Machine learning which is a part of AI, is a branch of data science which enables computers to learn from existind training data without explicit programming to make specualtions on new data points. A subclass of machine learning that is the deep learning bases on neural networks, containing a large number of layers, made possible due to recent computational advancements. In the radiomics research which focuses on medical imaging data as quantitative imaging biomarkers.The major aim of AI based research in neuro-oncologic imaging is to better understand the advanced manifestations of heterogeneous central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms in hopes of improving patient outcomes.

### Machine Learning Methods

Most applications of machine learning in medical imaging have relied on supervised forms of machine learning, which consist of algorithms that are trained on “ground truth” labels. Labels can include different classes of diagnoses (eg, high- vs lower-grade glioma), different prognoses (eg, long vs short survival), or different classes that exist within a single set of image volumes (eg, enhancing tumor vs necrotic tissue vs edema vs normal brain tissue). When provided with sufficient examples of the different classes, algorithms “learn” how to classify novel data. Supervised machine learning methods include logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, as well as tools useful for clinical decision support (eg, decision trees and Bayesian networks) (1,2). In general, these traditional supervised approaches are applied to explicitly engineered intermediate features, often after a step of feature reduction, which is necessary to reduce model complexity and avoid overfitting (ie, memorizing the training sample cases rather than learning the relevant pattern)—a prevalent problem that creeps into many machine learning studies without proper “held out” validation samples. These approaches, while powerful, oftentimes require extensive, domain-specific, expert knowledge about the underlying biologic basis of the process being studied. Another frequently used category of machine learning is unsupervised algorithms, such as k-means clustering, which can generate novel groupings or categories from complex data sets and have important roles in discovery science and big data.

### Does artificial intelligence pose a threat to human intelligence towards glioma therapy?

Several research on neuro oncology focused on diffuse gliomas, World Health Organization (WHO) graded II–IV tumors, which were typically divided into lower grade gliomas (WHO grade II and III) and glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Different work focused on glioblastoma, given that it represented more than half the malignant primary brain tumors and had an aggressive course and grim prognosis. Lower grade gliomas could sometimes progress into glioblastoma, and those were known as secondary glioblastomas. A variety of other brain tumors, including World Health Organisation grade I tumors, pediatric Central Nervous System tumors, primary Central Nervous System lymphoma, and brain metastases, forcused mainly on important areas of neuro oncology but represented less- ctive areas of research given smaller sample sizes, more disease heterogeneity, and relatively lower morbidity.![maxresdefault](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94965887/151661238-80d52a3b-bef1-4dc4-b46a-0a5a6288e9fb.jpg) 
All these aggressive behaviours of gliomas are maily attributed to their rapid proliferation, unravelled genomics and the blood brain barrier which protects the tumor cells from chemotherapeutic regimens. Brain tumors are oftenly assessed by the magnetic resonance imaging anf computed tomography. Such images allowed surgeons to make decisions on tumor grading, intra operative pathology, feasibility of surgery and how the treatment was to be done. All these data forms would be complied manually by pysicians which took more time to validate results and conclude treatment modality. 
In this context, artificial intelligence proved promising performance in diagnosis and mamagement of gliomas, to begin with grading prediction to outcome evaluation tumor lesion have been precisely been differentiated from health tissues. Due to the pertaining issues of the reliability and transparency of artifical intelligence, its utility in neuro oncological field remains limited,

### Conclusion

The ain of this research is to improve the outcomes of patients affected by Central Nervous System neoplasms through improvements in diagnostic and treatment methods. Artificial Intelligence tools that combine clinical, radiomic, and genomic information into predictive models hold substantial promises for guiding and monitoring personalized therapys. However, a number of challenges exist and much work is required to be done to bring the promise of this field into fruition. Nevertheless, radiologic practice will substantially change as Artificial Intelligence technologies continue to improve to be able to enhance radiologists’ accuracy and efficiency. It is crucial for the future radiologist to understand and appropriately use these powerful tools as they become more integrated into everyday clinical practice in the coming years.
